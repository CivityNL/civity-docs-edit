> CKAN is a database management interface that allows you to manipulate data.

Dataplatform is comprised of two main platforms, the **Portal** and **CKAN**.

CKAN allows you to change, add, and delete data. However, in order to manipulate data, you must possess valid login credentials (contact your system administrator for this). Additionally, all data is catalogued by different organizations, who retain ownership of their datasets (data).
