> Metadata is simply data about data

Every dataset contains metadata. For open data we follow the guidelines set in the DCAT-Standard.

Metadata is information that provides data about other data. Typically this means a description and context about existing data.

For example, the numbers `14, 16.5, 21, 18, 21` are inthemselves meaningless and contextless. However, you would use metadata to describe what these represent. 

Knowing this, we could add `degrees centigrade`, which now describes the numerical set of `14, 16.5, 21, 18, 21`. Therefore, `degrees centigrade` is the metadata for the numerical set of `14, 16.5, 21, 18, 21`.
