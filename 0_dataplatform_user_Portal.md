> The portal is a public-facing interface for datasets (contained in CKAN), themes and stories.

Dataplatform is comprised of two solutions, the **Portal** and **CKAN**.

The portal is where all of your data is presented, which is derived from datasets in our CKAN instance. Essentially, the portal represents a user friendly interface for presenting, searching and providing data that is stored in CKAN.
