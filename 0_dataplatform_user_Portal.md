> The portal is a public-facing interface for datasets contained in CKAN.

Dataplatform is comprised of two main platforms, the **Portal** and **CKAN**.

The portal is where all of your data is presented, which is derrived from datasets in our CKAN instance. Essentially, the portal represents a public facing shell around our database. Furthermore, the portal allows you to conduct elastic searches, which enables you to retrieve data more conveniently.
