Adding a dataset represents the first step in adding a new data entry. The second step is [adding a datasource](datasets_AddingDatasources)

## Title
> The title you choose will be rendered as part of the dataset‚Äôs URL. The URL is generated in the following template: [https://www.dataplatform.nl/data/YOUR_TITLE](#blank).  When the title is generated into a URL, capital letters will be converted to small letters and spaces will be replaced by hyphens ( - ).

A title is a unique identifier ‚Äì it must be short and specific. For example, ‚Äú**Sport Events 2016 Utrecht**‚Äù is much more specific than ‚Äú**Sporting Events**.‚Äù For best results, specify the location of the dataset inside the title, as this will allow users to better find your dataset on <a href="https://www.dataplatform.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dataplatform</a>.

A good naming guideline to follow when creating a title:
```sh
root_category - subject - location:year - version:number
```
An example using our naming guideline:
```sh
Sport - Sport Events - Utrecht 2019 - Version 1
```

## Description
This field represents an overview of your dataset. Your description should answer the following questions: 

* What is the data about?
* Where does the data come from?
* What is the quality of the data?
* Over what timeframe or period was the data recorded?

You may use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">markdown formatting</a> in the description field. This allows you to utilize headers, lists, **bold**, and *italics.*

For example, the following raw markdown:

```sh
* **Description:** Sporting Events Utrecht
* **Source:** Permits Department
* **Target:** Providing insights into events from the municipality
* **Limitations:** This dataset is not to be used for legal purposes
* **Possibilities:** This dataset may be used for insight into locations on a map
* *Coordinate System:* *WGS84*
```

Will be rendered as:

* **Description:** Sporting Events Utrecht
* **Source:** Permits Department
* **Target:** Providing insights into events from the municipality
* **Limitations:** This dataset is not to be used for legal purposes
* **Possibilities:** This dataset may be used for insight into locations on a map
* *Coordinate System:* *WGS84*


### Visibility / Zichtbaarheid
> Visibility is set to private by default. Choose ‚Äúpublic‚Äù to make the dataset available as open data on <a href="https://www.dataplatform.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dataplatform.nl</a>

CKAN Dataplatform has two types of visibility options: private and public. Datasets that are marked as ***private*** are only viewable in <a href="https://ckan.dataplatform.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CKAN</a> for users with the correct organizational rights; the dataset is not viewable on <a href="https://www.dataplatform.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dataplatform</a>.

The visibility status of your dataset is indicated by a label in the top-right corner.

### Searchability / Zichtbaarheid Dataplatform 
>Searchability is only available if the visibility is set to ***private***

If a dataset is set to ***Private***, the metadata will be shown on CKAN without an available datasource. 

>When searchability is set to onzichtbaar, only users with the correct origanizational rights can see the datasource 
When searchability is set to zichtbaar, all users in CKAn can see the metadata, but cannot reach the datasource 



| Visibility | Searchability  |appearance dataplatform.nl   |   appearance ckan.dataplatform.nl | 
| ----------  | ------------------ | -----------------------------------     | ----------------------------   | 
| Public     | Blocked          | Available                                     | Metadata and datasources available | 
| Private    | Zichtbaar       | Not available                        | Metadata available, datasource not available| 
| Private    | Onzichtbaar       | Not available                         | Metadata and datasource not available | 


### Language / Taal 
The default language is set to‚ÄØNederlands, but additional options are available from the drop-down box.‚ÄØ 


### Metadata Language / Metadata Taal 
The default language is set to‚ÄØNederlands, but additional options are available from the drop-down box.‚ÄØ 


## Tags
> It is advisable to enter tags that do not appear in the description or title of your dataset. Dataplatform already indexes keywords in the Title and Description fields.

Tags influence search terms. Utilizing tags will make your datasets easier to find. Entering the first few letters of your intended tag will make Dataplatform search for the closest existing match ‚Äì if it matches, click on the tag in the dropdown list.

If your intended tag does not match any existing entries, complete the entire word, then hit the *return* key. Once your new tag has been entered, it is now possible to use this as an existing tag.
If you select the wrong tag, you may remove it by click on the cross ‚ÄúX‚Äù in front of the word.
