DataPlatform is the basic facility for managing data. Data platform is mainly about publishing open data in a structured way, with the right metadata, aimed at the external users.

DataPlatform is comprised of two solutions, the **Portal** and **CKAN**.

The portal is the website for data-consumers, where they can find datasets (contained in CKAN), themes, showcases and stories. The portal is a user friendly interface for presenting, searching and providing data that is stored in CKAN. 

CKAN is the tool to manage the data. It allows you to change, add, and delete data. However, in order to manipulate data, you must possess valid login credentials (contact your system administrator for this).
