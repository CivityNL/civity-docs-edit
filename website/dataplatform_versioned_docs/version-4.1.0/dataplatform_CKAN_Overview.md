### Language selection

CKAN supports many European languages. Presently, CKAN DataPlatform is available in Dutch (Nederlands), English, and Swedish.

## Datasets

> Datasets are managed at `https://ckan-{organisation-name}-dataplattform-se.dataplattform.se` and presented at `https://{organisation-name}.dataplattform.se`

CKAN uses 'datasets' to organize data (which are called _packages_ in CKAN). A dataset is a packet of data, for example 'the crime figures in the city' or 'the humidity readings of a weather station'. When the user searches for data, the results are visible in the individual datasets.

Datasets comprise of two main aspects:

- A collection of one or more datasources (which are called _resources_ in CKAN)
- Metadata

## Dataset Metadata

The metadata contains information about the collection of datasources in the dataset. The metadata should give information about:

- Who owns the dataset
- Descriptive information about the content
- Access rights

## Datasources

A dataset is comprised of a collection of resources; these are the actual files or links that provide data. Your dataset may be comprised of a single source, or many sources, any file format, and must contain explicit metadata.

## Metadata

> Metadata is simply data about data

Every dataset contains metadata. For open data we follow the guidelines set in the DCAT-Standard.

Metadata is information that provides data about other data. Typically this means a description and context about existing data.

For a comprehensive example, see [Metadata](metadata_Metadata#metadata-example)
