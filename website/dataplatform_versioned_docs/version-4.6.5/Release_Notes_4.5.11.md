# Config versioning

- add versioning to the settings model
- add a title to the header version display so we can see the config version
- increase the version font size so that it is accessibility complient
- remove `<header> </header>` since it blocks the header from sticking to the top when scrolling down. Apperently this isn't a accessibility issue either.
