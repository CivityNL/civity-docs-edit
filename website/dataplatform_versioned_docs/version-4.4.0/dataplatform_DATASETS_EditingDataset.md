## Adding Groups

> A group is a thematic bundling of datasets. The list of groups is based on <a href="https://docs.dataportal.se/dcat/en/#5.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DCAT themes</a>

To improve findability, each dataset is added to a group via the 'Theme' meta data field.

<!-- The tab to add a group is next to the input data of the data set. Choose the theme that fits the dataset from the drop down list. The themes are consistent with the list as used by <a href="https://data.overheid.nl" target="_blank">Data Overheid</a>. -->
