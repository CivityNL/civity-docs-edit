* **Create feature timeout Bug** As a safety measure, when getting map objects information takes to long the call would be rejected (2 seconds). For Utrecht this happens sometimes eventho later on it would load. This safety measure has now been removed. The downside of this could be if the response never arrives that the function waits forever.
