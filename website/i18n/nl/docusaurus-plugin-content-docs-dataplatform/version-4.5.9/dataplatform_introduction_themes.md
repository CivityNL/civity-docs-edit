DataPlatform is the basic facility for managing data. Data platform is mainly about publishing open data in a structured way, with the right metadata, aimed at the external users.

DataPlatform is comprised of two solutions, the **Portal** and **CKAN**.

The portal is the website for data-consumers, where they can find datasets (contained in CKAN), themes, showcases and stories. The portal is a user friendly interface for presenting, searching and providing data that is stored in CKAN.

## CKAN

> CKAN is the tool to manage the data. It allows you to change, add, and delete data. However, in order to manipulate data, you must possess valid login credentials (contact your system administrator for this).

DataPlatform uses the open source software CKAN. This is the most widely used software for open data environments worldwide.

CKAN stands for "Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network," which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application" target="_blank">web-based</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">open-source</a> management system for the storage and distribution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data" target="_blank">open data</a>.

Civity's DataPlatform uses a CKAN instance as our web-based tool for dataset, resource, and metadata maintenance.

You may find our CKAN instance at <a href="https://ckan.dataplatform.nl/" target="_blank">ckan.dataplatform.nl</a>.

The CKAN environment of DataPlatform has been expanded with additional extensions such as the DataStore (API), Data Dictionary (Data dictionary) and GeoServer.
