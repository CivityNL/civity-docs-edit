Datasets comprise of two main aspects: 
* A collection of datasources 
* Metadata 


## Dataset Metadata 
The metadata contains information about the collection of datasources in the dataset. The metadata should give information about: 
* Who owns the dataset 
* Descriptive information about the content 
* Access rights 

## Datasources 
A dataset is comprised of a collection of datasources; these are the actual files or links that provide data. Your datasource may be comprised of a single sources, or many sources, any file format, and must contain explicit metadata. 

## Metadata 
> Metadata is simply data about data 

Every dataset contains metadata. For open data we follow the guidelines set in the DCAT-Standard. 

Metadata is information that provides data about other data. Typically this means a description and context about existing data.
