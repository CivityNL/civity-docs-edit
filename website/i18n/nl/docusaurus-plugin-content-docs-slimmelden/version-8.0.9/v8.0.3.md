title: Release Notes v8.0.3
---

* **Left menu is no longer swipe able.** Previously you could swipe from the left side of the app and the legenda would pop up. This is annoying rather than handy so it is disabled.

* **Swiping left and right no longer goes to previous or next page.** A common page functionality is to swipe left or right to go the previous page. This works counter productive when you are using a map to navigate, there for the functionality has been disabled.

* **Reintroducing the closed report icon.** This was not introduced in 8.0.0, this version reintroduces a grey icon when a report has been closed.

* **Showing closed reports on objects is no longer supported.** Previously for some municipality when a report was created for an object and that report was closed it would appear as a closed icon on the map. Where users could see what had been fixed. We no longer support this feature since it occupies an object without making it able for users to make a new report on the object.
