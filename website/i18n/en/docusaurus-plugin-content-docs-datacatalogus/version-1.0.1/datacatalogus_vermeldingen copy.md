Information products usually use several separate datasets. A dashboard or management report is often composed of multiple data sources. DataCatalog provides insight into the sources used in a particular information product via linked listings. Conversely, for owners and managers it is immediately visible who is using the data. In the event of changes, all parties involved can be informed immediately.

## How to link a listing?

By clicking on Manage within the listing, it is possible to add a new linked listing via the Linked Listings tab.

## Where to see linked listings?

When you click on a listing, you'll see a linked listing tab with the number of listings linked in parentheses. When you click on this you will see an overview of other listings that are used within this listing.
