In order to view private datasets and to add, edit or delete datasets, you need be logged in. Your login permissions are configured at the organization-level; you have the possibility to be a member in one or more organizations. This allows you to manage multiple datasets across different organizations. Each organization also contains different user permission levels; roles.

For more information about user permissions, see [Standard Users](standaard_gebruikers).

## Login

Login credentials are controlled on an invite only basis; access can be granted to CKAN by your organization's administrator. Once access has been granted, you can reset your password via the 'forgot password' option. A link to set your password will be sent to the provided email address.

The login button is located at the top of the page on the right side. Here you will login with your username and password.

:::note Single Sign-on

If your organization set up a Single Sign-on connection, you can login with your organization credentials. Authorization is done via open source software Keycloak, instead of the regular CKAN login.
