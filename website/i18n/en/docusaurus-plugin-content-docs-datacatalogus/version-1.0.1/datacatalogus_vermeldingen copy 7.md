To view listings, it is not necessary to be logged in. CKAN users can login with their user account. Login is required for all edits to the entries.
Anyone accessing the DataCatalogue within the municipality (from an IP address that is on the whitelist) can view the listings.

A listing contains (depending on the dataproduct) data.
This data is metadata.
Metadata are defined in different standards:

- DCAT - for all datasets
- INSPIRE - for geodata
- Independent - own metadata set for the DataCatalogue

For each entry, the following metadata are entered as a minimum:

- Title
- Description
- Organization
- Keywords / tags
- Theme
- Type of data product
- Owner

Based on the entered data, the source can be traced. The owner can be contacted if the original is not freely available. The actual data source do not have to be added to DataCatalog. In DataCatalog, sources are not the basis, but the interpretation of the source: where can you find it, what can you use it for, who collected the data product.

## Search
