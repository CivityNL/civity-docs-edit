To view public listings, it is not necessary to be logged in. Anyone accessing the DataCatalog within the municipality (from an IP address that is on the whitelist) can view public listings. Users can login with their user account in order to see private listings. Login is also required to edit listings.

A listing contains (depending on the dataproduct) data.
This data is both metadata and can be (a link to) actual data sources.

Metadata are defined in different standards:

- DCAT - for all datasets
- INSPIRE - for geodata
- Client specific - own metadata set for the DataCatalog

For each listing, the following metadata are entered as a minimum:

- Title
- Description
- Organization
- Keywords / tags
- Theme
- Type of data product
- Owner

Based on the entered data, the source can be traced. The owner can be contacted if the original is not freely available. The actual data source does not have to be added to DataCatalog. In DataCatalog, sources are not the basis, but the interpretation of the source: where can you find it, what can you use it for, who collected the data product.

## Search

By using the search bar you can search for:

- (part of the) Title
- (part of) Description
- Tags (Also called Labels or Keywords)

Searching is possible only on a whole word and is case independent. The listings (that meet the search criteria) of all organizations are listed below each other. This list can be sorted in different ways.
