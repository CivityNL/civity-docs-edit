## Workflow DataCatalog

Data within the DataCatalog consists of listings. Managing the listings involves several people. Between the entry and publication of the data, there are also various steps and authorizations. DataCatalog provides a comprehensive role and rights structure and support for various publishing steps. This way you keep full control over your data, access and management.

The entry goes through a number of steps in the DataCatalog to be publicly listed. This means that the listing is published so that the members within the assigned organization/department can view the listing.
After the listing has been created, this can be done by an editor or admin, the entry can be made public (public) by an admin of that organization / department with 1 press of the button. A public entry is visible and findable in the DataCatalog.
