## Data Dictionary

The Data Dictionary is a module that automatically displays column names and data types for specific reources. The Data Dictionary is only available for file types that are DataStored. When you click on a listing and then on a (Datastored) resource you can find the Data Dictionary at the bottom (after the preview of the data).

### Editing a Data Dictionary

When you are on the page where you can see the Data Dictionary, click on Manage, you will end up in the management environment of the resource. Here you will see the tab `Data dictionary`. When you click on it, you can change the Data Dictionary for this resource.
