## Assigning Listings to Themes

> Only authorized users will be able to select themes

Assigning a theme can be done via two paths:

Path 1 (editors/admins):

1. Select a listing. Click `Manage` to go to the metadata edit screen.
2. Adjust the metadata field `Theme` to the correct theme.
3. Click on the THEMES tab on top of the page. The listing will now be listed under the selected theme.

Path 2 (sysadmin only):

1. Select a listing. Click on the tab `Themes` which is shown above the title of the listing.
2. Select the desired theme and click on the blue `Add to theme` button.
3. Click on the THEMES tab on top of the page. The listing will now be listed under the selected theme.

:::caution Caution

With Path 2 you can specify multiple themes as a sysadmin. Under the THEMES tab you will see that the listing will then show up under multiple themes. However, via Path 1 you can only specify one theme. Consequently, when editing and saving other metadata, this will overwrite the multiple themes to the one that is specified in the metadata. In general, we advise sysadmins to not be involved in editing themes / listings.
