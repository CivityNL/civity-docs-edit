## Themes are CKAN Groups

When you click on the main THEMES menu, you will see an overview of all themes. The themes in CKAN are seen as groups. When you click on a particular theme, you'll get an overview of all the listings associated with a particular theme.

:::note What are CKAN Groups?

CKAN Groups are used to create and manage collections of datasets. This could be to collect listings for a particular project or team, or on a particular theme, or as a very simple way to help people find and search your own published listings.
