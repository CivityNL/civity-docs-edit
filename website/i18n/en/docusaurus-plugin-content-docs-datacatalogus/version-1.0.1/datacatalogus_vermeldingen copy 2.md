Listings that are removed, are not immediately disappeared completely from CKAN. Although the listing will no longer appear on CKAN and will no longer appear in search results, the URL still exists. This URL can only be accessed by people with the right rights. When you access this URL, the deleted listing can be recognized by a special 'tag' after the title: [Deleted]. Contact the system administrator to remove the listing completely. Only then can the URL be used again for a new listing.
