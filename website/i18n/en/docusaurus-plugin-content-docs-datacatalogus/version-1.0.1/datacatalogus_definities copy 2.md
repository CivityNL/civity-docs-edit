## Add defintions to listings

When you click on a listing, you will be taken to the overview page of this listing. You can recognize this page by the attachments and extra information sections. From this page you can go to the management environment of the listing by clicking on the `Manage` button. On the edit page, you'll now see a tab titled `Definitions` with the number of definitions added to this entry in parentheses. When you click on Definitions, you can then add new definitions to the entry via a drop-down menu.
