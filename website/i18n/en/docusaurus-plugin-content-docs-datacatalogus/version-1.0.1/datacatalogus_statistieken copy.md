## What is Matomo?

Matomo (formerly known as Piwik) is a web analytics software platform. It provides detailed reports on your website and its visitors, including the search engines and keywords they used, the language they speak, which pages they like, the files they download, and so much more.

## How do we use Matomo at Civity?

We have three Matomo instances:

https://tst-matomo.dataplatform.nl/
https://acc-matomo.dataplatform.nl/
https://matomo.dataplatform.nl/

On each instance, we currently track both DataPlatform portals as well as DataCatalog instances. Each municipality has (or should have) at least one user responsible for accessing the Matomo dashboard in order to have access to collected data.
