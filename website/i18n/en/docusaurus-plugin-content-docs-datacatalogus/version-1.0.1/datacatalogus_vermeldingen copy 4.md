## View Activity Stream

Within a listing, there is the option to click on the Activity Stream tab. Here you will find an overview with changes to the relevant listing with the name of the user who made the change. In addition, you can see when the change has taken place.

In the current CKAN version, it is not shown exactly what kind of change has taken place. All activities take the following form:

`[username] updated the Entry [entry title] [x minutes/hour/days] ago`

By subscribing to a listing, you can see the specific activity flow for a listing in your dashboard.

:::note Note

Activities are only visible to public listings. Changes to private listings are recorded in the database but are not visible in the Activity Stream tab.
