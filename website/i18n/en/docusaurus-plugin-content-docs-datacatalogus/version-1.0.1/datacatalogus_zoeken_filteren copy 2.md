> DataCatalog offers extensive possibilities to search for data and information, such as through keywords, description, organization, theme or definitions. Links through Definitions and 'Linked Listings' create a better picture of the connection between all sources and data products.

## Find Listings

In DataCatalogue, there are many different ways to search for listings.

A first step is to determine through which search input you want to find a listing. Below you will see an overview of the search entries within the DataCatalog environment:

- Search bar
- Filters
- Themes / Organizations (through tiles/icons)
- Through Definitions
- Through Linked Listings

### Search Bar

The search bar can be used to search for listings by searching for words that appear in the metadata of the specific listing.

For example, you can search for the title and description of the listing, but also for keywords that are indicated in the metadata.

Searching is only possible on a whole word. Whether the search term is written in uppercase or lowercase letters does not matter to the search result.

> #### Examples
>
> -Invoices returns a number of notifications. (search by whole word only)
> -Fact does not return notifications (not the whole word) Numbers can also be entered as a search term.
> -303 is a correct search term By adding a + between two words, both words are searched for.
> -303 + invoices -> you get all the datsets that have 1 of the two words in them.

The listings (that match the search query) of all organizations are listed below each other.

The list can be sorted in different ways.

### Filters

Within the DataCatalog, filters can be set to create a table of listings that meet 1 or more filters. These filters are based on desired metadata fields and can be configured as desired.

### Themes (Groups) / Organizations via Tiles

Via the `THEMES` page, which can be selected at the top of the page, you can search for listings within a specific theme by clicking on a tile. If you are a member of multiple organizations, you can view listings within a specific organization in the same way via the `ORGANIZATIONS` page.

### Definitions

You can search for listings that match a particular definition. If you click on a specific definition through the Definitions page, you will see a list of listings associated with this definition.

### Linked Listings

When you click on a listing, you'll see a heading with Linked Listings. Here you can find listings related to the listing you're currently viewing.

## View a Listing

After you've found the right listing using one of the methods above, you can click on the listing title to go to the actual listing.

On this page you will now see an overview of attachments that belong to this specific listing. The attachment can be an actual uploaded data product (e.g. a csv file), but can also contain a reference (URL) to the source (e.g. ArcGISonline, Power BI). By clicking on the attachment you will be taken to either the dataproduct or a link to the dataproduct.
