## Standard Users

All other users will be standard users. The rights for these users depend on their role within an organization.

Users can be assigned a certain role within an organization by the system administrators / administrators by clicking on an organization and then going to `Manage` and clicking on the `Members` tab. A distinction can be made between three roles (Member/Editor/Administrator).

Being assigned to a particular organization determines in large sizes what a user can and cannot see/do within the DataCatalog:
For instance, when you are a member of an organization, you can see all listings, both public and private, within that organization/department but you are not able to edit or create any listings.

:::note Note

As a standard user in general, it is possible to see listings outside of your own organization. You will, however, only see listings within other organizations that are listed as public.

Below you will see an overview of rights for the different roles within an organization:
