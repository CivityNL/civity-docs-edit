## Connection with DataPlatform and the Open Data portal.

Whereas DataPlatform is used to publish metadata outside of an organization, DataCatalog is used within an organization to manage metadata and data from that organization. It allows employees responsible for certain datasets to make this dataset discoverable by their colleagues by publishing metadata on these datasets. In general, DataCatalog is only accessible from within the network of the organization. Metadata records and datasets (called 'Listings' in DataCatalog) can be forwarded from DataCatalog to DataPlatform. DataPlatform is accessible from the internet. Organizations who have both DataCatalog and DataPlatform can use DataCatalog to manage their DataPlatform. DataCatalog has options to indicate whether or not a metadata record should be published in DataPlatform. If this link is activated, any update on a metadata record in DataCatalog is automatically propagated to DataPlatform. Once the link is de-activated, a metadata record is withdrawn from DataPlatform. Logging in to DataPlatform is not needed in this case. Organizations who do not use DataCatalog though have to log in to DataPlatform to manage their data.

In DataCatalog, an organization can create multiple CKAN organizations, for example one for each department. In DataPlatform, metadata are usually published using a limited number of CKAN organizations. For example, in DataCatalog the Rotterdam municipality has defined CKAN organizations for all departments, plus a couple of organizations which are affiliated to the municipality such as the public transport company and the local health authorities. All metadata are published in DataPlatform under the “Gemeente Rotterdam” flag.

DataCatalog can be adapted to the corporate identity of the customer up to a certain extent. Part of this customization can be done by the customer (changing the logo and texts on the frontpage), part of this customization has to be done by Civity (modifying the CSS).

## Metadata Field - Link to DataPlatform

Within the metadata edit screen for a listing you can set whether you want to push a catalog listing as open data to DataPlatform. This will only happen if the listing is a public listing. By setting the metadata field 'Link to DataPlatform' to 'Yes'. You can publish a DataCatalog listing to DataPlatform.
