Users can have different roles and rights within the DataCatalog.

There is a distinction between system administrators (sysadmins) and standard users.

## System Administrator

System administrators have the most extensive access rights. Only a few system administrators are active on behalf of the municipality and will be assigned in consultation.

As a system administrator, you have the rights to view and modify all organizations and to assign users to specific parts of the DataCatalog. System administrators can also assign certain roles to users. In addition, as a system administrator you have access to site configuration settings through the _hammer_ icon next to your username at the top right.

See the CKAN documentation for more information about the different rights and roles as a system administrator https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/sysadmin-guide.html.
