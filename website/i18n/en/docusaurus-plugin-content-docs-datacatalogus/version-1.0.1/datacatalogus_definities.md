## Definitions Module

:::note

Only Data Officers can add/edit/delete defintions

:::

From each page you can go to the Definition module by clicking on the heading DEFINITIONS at the top of the page.

With the Definition module it is possible to manage (internal and external) definitions and easily link them to listings.

When you click on a Definition in Datacatalog, you can see that in addition to a title and description of the Definition, metadata is also added.

Finally, it is possible to see which listings are linked to a particular Definition.

To add a definition you go to the `DEFINITIONS` tab. There you click `Add Definition`. Here you fill in at least: the title and description. Then you click on save, the definition is saved an can be linked to a listing.
