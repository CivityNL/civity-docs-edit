CKAN Organizations are used to create, manage and publish collections of listings. Different users can have different roles within an organization. Depending on authorization level they can add, modify, and publish listings.

## Add a new Organization

Organizations can only be added by users with the appropriate permissions. Assuming you have the right authorization level, you are able to click on the `ORGANIZATIONS` tab in the main menu and you will see a blue button with `Add Organization`.
