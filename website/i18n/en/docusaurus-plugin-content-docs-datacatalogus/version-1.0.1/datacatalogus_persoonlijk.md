## Account info

By clicking on your username at the very top of the page, you will be taken to your personal profile page. Here you can find your API key and view your activity flow. Your API key is private and unique, don't share it with anyone.

## Personal profile

Your user profile contains information about your personal and account information; you can only see your user profile if you are logged in.

On this page you can see which datasets you own, your activity stream and your personal data. If you click on the title of a dataset, you will be redirected to that dataset.

The personal information displayed on the Account Information page includes the following:

- **User information**
- **Email** this is private - organization admins can't see your email
- **Member since**
- **Status** - active or pending
- **API key** - this is private

## Change password

In addition, it is possible to adjust certain settings of your account via your personal profile. For security reasons, it is recommended to frequently renew your password and API key.

This can be done by clicking on the Manage button. At the bottom you will see Change password. After changing the password, click Update Profile

Or by clicking on the gear-icon next to your name, you get to the page you can update your profile.

:::note

Some of the settings might not be available for clients that use Single Sign-on. For instance, changing your password is not available for SSO users because for SSO this is managed outside of DataCatalog.
