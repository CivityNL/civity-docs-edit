Billing settings are divided into **Charging &amp; Gateway** and **Credit Card Policies** , both can be found in _Audience/Billing_.

When setting up your billing configuration, you can choose between **Prepaid** and **Postpaid**.

- Prepaid mode: In prepaid mode, all fixed fees and setup fees are billed immediately at the beginning of the month or at the beginning of any pro-rated billing period. Variable costs are always calculated at the end of the month.
- Postpaid mode: In postpaid mode, all fixed fees as well as variable fees are billed at the end of the month.

To do so, navigate to _Audience/Billing/Charging &amp; Gateway._
