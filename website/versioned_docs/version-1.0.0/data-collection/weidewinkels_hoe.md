The idea behind our Farmer Shops example is quite simple. We created a form where people can add information about Farmer Shops. Everybody can use the form to add a new Farmer Shop. The idea is to use crowdsourcing to create a bigger and bigger dataset with as many Farmer Shops as possible.

An example of the Dutch form can be found at:

The data is being collected in a CSV file, which can be publicly viewed at the following url:
