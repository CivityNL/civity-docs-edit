## Collect your own datasets

With the Data Collection Toolkit it's easy to create and collect your own datasets. It can be on any topic. Have a look at Dataplatform.nl first to see if your dataset already exists.

## Example: Farmer Shops and local food

To show what you can do with the Data Collection Toolkit we have made an example. We created a data-entry form to collect data about farmer shops and local foods. It fits within our ambition as Civity to contribute to a more sustainable planet and promote locally produced food. 

In this documentation we will describe how you can develop your own data collection solution.
