SSO Integration is also supported.

Navigate to _Account Settings/Overview_ you can find your **Provider API** key to authenticate yourself.

## Invite users

In order to share the workload of administering your APIs, you may wish to invite team members from your organization to access the 3scale Admin Portal.

The 3scale Admin Portal has two types of users:

- Admins: Which have full access to all areas and services, and can invite other members (if your plan allows it).
- Members: Which have limited access to areas of the product (e.g. Analytics, Developer Portal) and, if you are an enterprise customer, also to services.

Navigate to _Account Settings/Users/Listing_ and click on the _Invite a New User._

Additionally, you can find the list and status of sent invitations in _Users/Invitation_s.
