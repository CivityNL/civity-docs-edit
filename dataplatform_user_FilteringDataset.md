It is possible to filter results based on:
* Organizations
* Groups
* Tags
* File format



## Filtering Datasets by Multiple Items
Filtering can be accomplished by the use of more than one filter.

## Removing Filters
Filters may be removed from a search, one-by-one, by clicking on the cross behind the selected filter.

You may remove filters either on the left-hand side of the page, in the filtering area, or at the top of the page.
