Deleting a dataset is not permanent. When you delete a dataset it becomes hidden, so it is no longer available in search results. The URL that belongs to the dataset is still accessable by users who posses the correct rights.

>*If you wish to permanently delete your dataset, please contact the administrator*

### How to Delete Your Dataset
1. Navigate to the Datasets page, and search for the dataset you wish to edit.
2. Select the “Edit” button – the metadata page will now appear. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page, where you will find the “Remove” button; select this button.
4. A separate window will open, asking you to confirm deletion. Click “confirm”
