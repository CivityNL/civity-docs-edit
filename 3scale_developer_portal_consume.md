## Register / Subscribe to an API Application plan

1. An API developer can be registered to the Developer Portal by choosing a plan to signup. You can do this in the section &#39;Pick your plan&#39; on the lower end of the homepage.

1. You must then click on the activation link that was sent to your mailbox.

- Administrators can also activate the new account through 3scale API Admin Portal by navigating to _Audience/Accounts/Listing_ and click on _Activate_ for the specific new user.
- As long there are no Credit Cards / Billing gateways set up already, developers can free enroll on either free or paid Application plans.

1. After following the activation link, the newly registered API developer is redirected to login for the first time.

- Billing is not setup yet so no credit card credentials are going to be requested from the developer. Build-in functionality of 3scale API Management though will not allow to the developer to switch to a paid plan without providing billing / payment credentials.

## Access to Statistics

Navigate to _STATISTICS_ to get an overview of your API usage. Graphs are displayed based on the methods set by the API&#39;s administration.
