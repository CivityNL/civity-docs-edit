Datasets comprise of two main aspects:
* a collection of datasources
* metadata

> datasets are managed in CKAN.dataplatform and presented in portal.dataplatform

## Metadata in a dataset
The metadata of a dataset contains information about the collection of datasources in the dataset. The metadata should give information about:
* Who owns the dataset
* Descriptive information about the content
* Access rights

## Datasources
A dataset is comprised of a collection of datasources; these are the actual files or links that provide data. Datasources may be comprised of a single, or many sources, any file format, and must contain explicit metadata.
