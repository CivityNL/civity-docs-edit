Applications define the credentials to access your product. An application is always associated with one application plan that determines the access policies. Applications are stored within developer accounts.


## Create applications

A new application is automatically generated when a developer registers through the Developer Portal. This procedure can be also through the Admin portal.

Navigate to _Audience/Account_ click on _Create_ to create a new consumer and his application.
