>Workflow is unique to Datacatalogue.

In order to give everyone a change to add the metadata of a dataset in the datacatalogus without being the owner of the data, the workflow was set up. 

*Metadata that describes the data is added to the datacatalogue.* There is no datasource itself in the datacatalogue.  
The description of the datasource is called **vermelding** 

Everyone having access to the datacatalogue is able to add a dataset. The applicant adds the name of the owner of the data.  

>The owner of the data needs to have access to the datacatalogue 

Before the vermelding is publiced, the owner of the data checks the metadata in the datacatalogue. 

The owner receives a notification that a vermelding is assigned to his name. 

When the owner approves the vermelding and the fact that he/she is the owner of data mentioned in the vermelding, the vermelding is forwarded to the functional manager. 

When a functional manager approves the vermelding, he is the one that publish the vermedling into the datacatalogue.
