Sorting allows you to reorder datasets in different ways. 

> The list of datasets is dynamically altered by the criterea dictated by the filters

You may sort in the following ways:

<!-- ![imageStyle: sorting dropdown](assets/SortingDatasets/dataplatform_user_FilteringDataset_sort.png) -->

| Name | Explanation |
| :---- | :----------- |
| Relevance | first: score / second: last modified |
| Name Ascending | number followed by A-Z, based on title |
| Name Descending | Z-A followed by number, based on title |
| Rating Ascending | Datasets rated by best sorted on top |

## Filtering Datasets
Filtering datasets can be accomplished in various ways, using single or multiple filters. Filter options are shown ont he left-hand side of the of the dataset overview page in CKAN.

<!-- ![imageStyle: filter tree - PURPOSELY BROKEN FOR DEMO](assets/Dataplatform/FilteringDatasets/dataplatform_user_FilteringDataset_filtering.png) -->

It is possible to filter results based on:
* Organizations
* Groups
* Tags
* File format



### Filtering Datasets by Multiple Items
Filtering can be accomplished by the use of more than one filter.

### Removing Filters
Filters may be removed from a search, one-by-one, by clicking on the cross behind the selected filter.

You may remove filters either on the left-hand side of the page, in the filtering area, or at the top of the page.
