Only organization administrators may create new users

## Create a New User

From the organization's dataset page, select the "Manage" button, followed by the "Members" tab. Select the “Add Member” button.

Existing users are users who are already members in another organization. New users are users who are not members of any existing organization. To initiate setup of a new user, simply fill in their email address.

When you click “Add Member,” the new member will receive an automated email to the address entered. The username and user number will be generated from this email adress.

The new user's state will stay as "pending," until they confirm their email address.
