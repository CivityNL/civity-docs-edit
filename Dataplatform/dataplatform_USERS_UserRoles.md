> You must be logged in to add, edit, or delete datasets.

Your login permissions are configured at the organization-level; you have the possibility to be a member in one or more organizations. This allows you to manage multiple datasets across different organizations. Each organization also contains different user permission levels; roles. 

## Role Permissions
Roles set the permission levels that an organization's users possess; different roles grant different privileges. Each organization is currently limited to three roles.
