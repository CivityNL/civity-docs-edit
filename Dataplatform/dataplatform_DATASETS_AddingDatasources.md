Now that the metadata has been added, we can now add the dataset(s). Click on the “Next: Add Data” button at the bottom of the page.

## Source

You may add data via upload or via URL.

> If a CSV or (geo)JSON are uploaded, these will be accessible by Dataplatform’s API. Other datatypes are saved and provided as a download link.

## Additional Details

Additional information may be added here. The following information deals with the additional fields:

* Name: *This will be the filename, ensure it is descriptive*
* Description: *Provide an explanation of the contents of the file*
* Format: *The format in which the source is provided (CSV, XLS, JSON, PDF, etc).*

If you have additional sources to add, choose "Save & Add Another."
If you only have one, choose "End."

> CKAN will now save the file and create a dataset. The resulting entry is immediately viewable - if the visibility is set to "Public," the dataset will become viewable on <a href="https://www.dataplatform.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dataplatform</a>. "Private" datasets are not visible on Dataplatform.
